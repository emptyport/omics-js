            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="large-text">
                Why do we need omics libraries in JavaScript??? That is a valid question considering these sorts of things already exist in <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyteomics/">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/princelab/mspire">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://compomics.com/">Java</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/PGB-LIV/php-ms">PHP</a> just to name a few. While these other languages are all great, none of them are suited for front-end web development. Cloud computing is not going away anytime soon, and in order to leverage its power for the omics we need good front-end (and back-end) libraries.
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">
                The goal of omics.js is to make it easy for you to find existing libraries so that you can spend more time working on your project and less time sifting through code.
