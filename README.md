# omics.js

## About
Our purpose is to make it easy to find high quality, documented JavaScript libraries that are useful to the omics (proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, genomics, etc.).

You can find us online at [emptyport.github.io/omics-js](https://emptyport.github.io/omics-js).

## Contributing
If you have a library you want to add, you can fill out the form [here](https://emptyport.github.io/omics-js/contribute), or you can edit ```_data/projects.yaml``` and submit a pull request.

If you would like to make improvements to the website itself, clone this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and can be built by running ```bundle install``` and then ```bundle exec jekyll s```. The site will then be live at ```localhost:4000```.
